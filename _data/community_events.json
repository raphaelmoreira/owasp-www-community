        "description": "**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* **You need to reverse into the parking spot!**\n\nOWASP Aarhus and Siemens Gamesa are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup - in Brande.\n\n**19:00 \u2013 19:10** Morten Thrane\nWelcome by Siemens Gamesa and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:10 \u2013 20:00** Matija Stevanovic\n**Title:** *Safeguarding Wind Power \u2013 Cybersecurity in the context of Wind Power Plants*\n**Abstract:**\nIn recent years, the global energy landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation, with renewable energy sources emerging as pivotal players in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Among these, wind power has surged to the forefront, harnessing the natural force of wind to generate clean and efficient electricity. As we embrace the transition towards greener energy solutions, it is imperative that we also confront the challenges that accompany it. One such challenge, though perhaps less visible, is cybersecurity.\nThroughout this presentation, we will delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity as it pertains to wind power plants. We will explore the broader business context, provide overview of customer expectations and the increasingly stringent requirements imposed by national legislators. Additionally, we will sketch the threats and vulnerabilities facing these critical assets. Finally, we will provide an overview of the strategies and technologies deployed to mitigate these risks, ensuring the resilience and safety of our wind power infrastructure amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.\n\n**20:00 \u2013 20:30** Networking break\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** Aleksander Kj\u00e6r vil give en grundl\u00e6ggende introduktion til forhandling baseret p\u00e5 Harvard Negotiations Project og Uri & Fishers bog \"Getting to Yes\".\n\nHan vil introducere n\u00f8glekoncepterne og teknikkerne inden for forhandling og vise, hvordan deltagerne selv kan anvende disse til at forbedre deres forhandlingsevner - b\u00e5de professionelt og personligt. Det er hans holdning, at alle kan blive en dygtig forhandler!\nDerudover vil han illustrere disse teknikker med konkrete eksempler fra virkelige forhandlingssituationer.\n\nHan vil ogs\u00e5 pr\u00e6sentere, hvordan man kan overbevise en tv\u00e6r og n\u00e6rrig ledelse om at investere mere i IT-sikkerhed ved hj\u00e6lp af de forhandlingsteknikker, der har gennemg\u00e5et.\n\nKort om Aleksander - Jeg har en kandidatgrad i \u00f8konomi og antropologi og har altid haft stor interesse for forhandling gennem mine studier, is\u00e6r i en international kontekst. Bl.a. var jeg i praktik p\u00e5 den danske ambassade i Tallinn Estland i 2018, hvor der skete en masse inden for det milit\u00e6re og cyber- og informationssikkerhed omr\u00e5det i Danmark og Estland. Efterf\u00f8lgende tilbragte jeg fire m\u00e5neder i New York City, hvor jeg skrev mit speciale om danske virksomheders udfordringer med at etablere sig p\u00e5 det amerikanske marked. P\u00e5 nuv\u00e6rende tidspunkt studerer jeg softwareteknologi p\u00e5 6. semester og er s\u00e6rligt interesseret i governance-omr\u00e5det inden cyber- og informationssikkerhed, som jeg h\u00e5ber at g\u00f8re en karriere indenfor i fremtiden.\n\n**21:15 \u2013 21:30** Closing notes, networking and goodbyes"

Join us as we discuss vulnerabilities identified in [points.com](http://points.com/) and other pieces of airline infrastructure which lead to mass PII disclosure, an infinite money glitch, and free upgrades.\n\n**Talk #2 -** Secrets from a bygone era by **Dylan Ayrey**\nGitHub is a platform that was designed for sharing, it wasn't designed for unsharing. So how difficult does it become to unshare? This talk will dig into all the different ways your secrets might get replicated, propagated, persisted, and shared, for decades following your mistake.\n\n**Talk#3** The Internet is broken, Putting IPv6 into perspective\n**Description**:\nMost of the Internet is currently running on a legacy version of the Internet Protocol: IPv4. Despite of this, the number of engineers, especially in security, who know how to use IPv6 is relatively low. In this talk, previously presented internally at NCC Group, I will show you why today's Internet does not live up to its original vision, take you back to the past to show you what the IPv4 Internet used to look like and through this reveal the secrets that will make you understand IPv6.\n\n**Speaker**:**Denis Smajlovi\u0107,** Founding Security Consultant at Nova Information Security.

In this presentation, we aim to provide attendees with a new perspective and tools for evaluating the trustworthiness of open source code before using it in their own projects. This talk is for anyone who uses open source in their daily work. The goal is to raise awareness about the risks of software supply chain attackers hiding in open source code, and to demonstrate how easy it is for attackers to launch attacks. Attendees will learn about tools for detecting when they are being tricked and how to stay alert to potential threats.\n\n**\"SBOMS and why they can help make your software more secure\" - Anthony Harrison**\n\nWith a growing interest (or maybe it is just awareness) in Software Bill of Material (SBOM) raised by various initiatives from governments (US, EU and now the UK with the recently announced consultation on software security and resilience), SBOMs are starting (in certain markets) to form part of the development landscape. As software systems become increasingly complex relying on an extensive (and often unknown) software supply chain, it is essential to have a full understanding of all of the components which are used in a solution. This applies at all stages of the life cycle and an SBOM is considered to be a key artefact in providing the necessary information to support a vulnerability management process. This talk will explain what a SBOM is, how and when they should be produced (and some of the challenges that need to be overcome) and demonstrate how they should form part of a DevSecOPs lifecycle. I will try and supplement the talk with some demonstrations using a number of open source applications.\n\n**\"Decoding Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Unveiling Pain Points in SCA\" - Kaiwen Jiang**\n\nAn overview of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and its significance in bolstering software security. It includes discussions on SCA tools and key steps for implementation, and addresses challenges associated with SCA adoption.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Tal Folkman**\nTal Folkman is a security research team lead and accomplished expert in cybersecurity with over 8 years of experience in the field. Tal possesses exceptional skills in detecting and analyzing malicious code present in open-source software supply chains. In 2021, Tal joined Dustico, a software supply chain security startup that was later acquired by Checkmarx. Prior to this, she served for 5 years as both member and leader of IDF's Cybersecurity Red Team. Currently, Tal and her team are dedicated to identifying and combating software supply chain attackers, thereby ensuring the safety and security of the ecosystem.\n\n**Anthony Harrison**\nAnthony is an independent systems/software/cyber consultant. Anthony is a member of the OpenSSF SBOM Everywhere working group and SBOM Forum. Anthony has presented on SBOMs at FOSDEM (2002 and 2023), EuroPython 2022 and at PyCascades (Vancouver).

Meeting this challenge is not just about building secure applications since we all know that rapid development of software as well as the evolution of threats and vulnerabilities can see our applications as secure today but vulnerable tomorrow. That is why having an established product security team and response capability is extremely important.\nDuring this discussion, I will discuss, using real-world examples, including that of my own, how organizations can meet the demands of product security including:\n\n* Building a culture of security within your organization beyond firewalls and anti-virus\n* How to \u201csell\u201d security to executive management and explaining what product security does and doesn\u2019t do (e.g., staffing, budgets, etc.)\n* Building and deploying software using the \"DevOps\" approach, while maintaining a high level of security\n* Difficulties of wearing multiple hats, with security being one of them\n* Embedding \u201csecurity\u201d in the software development life cycle (SDLC)\n* Establishing a proper security \u201cresponse\u201d program\n* Product vulnerability transparency and developing a disclosure policy\n* How to measure the success of your program\n* Establishing a bug bounty program\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[DevOcean](https://www.devocean.security)*\n*DevOcean Unified Remediation Platform\u2122, a Gartner Cool Vendor, helps organizations cut the time, backlog, and manual effort needed to fix issues and manage threat exposure. Going beyond traditional methods, DevOcean enables security, dev and devops teams to collaborate efficiently without the usual pain and friction of day-to-day operations. Our powerful workflow automation engine leverages the unique context of cloud-to-code root cause analysis and ownership association to deliver a highly accurate remediation solution that drives resolution at scale.*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Walk-ins will not be permitted.**\n* **Google Security mandates that RSVPs include your full name (in Meetup settings) and that you bring your ID, which will be checked at the entrance to match your RSVP.**\n* If your first and last name do not appear in our admin view, we will contact you.\n* Alternatively, feel free to reach out directly or email us at orange-county-leaders@owasp.org to provide that information.\n\n**Parking**\nPark in the public garage structure next to the building. We will be providing paid tickets for exiting the garage.\n\n**Live Stream**\nStream us live on Twitch: http://twitch.tv/owaspoc\n*Please change your RSVP to \"No\" if you can't make it and will join via livestream instead.*\n\n**Abstract**\nNew vulnerabilities are disclosed every day in dependencies that you or your team may be using. But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This talk will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability \u2013 deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n**Workshop Overview:**\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n**Workshop Outline:**\nI. Overview (10 minutes)\nA. Workshop organization\nB. About the tools and sample applications\n\n1. What are the tools and applications we are going to use?\n\nC. Obtaining/installing the tools and sample applications\n2\\. Cloning from the github repo\n\nD. Goals of the workshop (what you will learn)\n3\\.

Unfortunately, many organizations are moving quickly to adopt AI in development with little thought of security consequences. Threat modeling enable security analysts to understand the additional risks that development with LLMs represents. This session will provide an overview of AI and LLM security challenges and demonstrate how threat modeling can identify potential security weaknesses. Inspired by the OWASP Top 10 list for LLMs, the session will provide a threat modeling approach for LLMs that is straightforward to adopt in production.\n\n**NOTE: there will be door prize drawings for those that attend in person**\n\nAGENDA\n\n* Lunch: 11 to 11:30\n* Meeting Kick-off (JoeG: 15 min)\n* Presentation: (30 min)\n* John Dickson: CEO Bytewhisper Security\n* Threat Modeling for Large Language Models\n* AI Survey Results and Panel Discussion (15 min)\n* John Dickson: CEO Bytewhisper Security\n* Edward Contreras: CISO Frost Bank\n* Topics for Future Meetings (Priya Parthasarathy) (10 min)\n* Membership and Door Prizes (Brent Daugherty) (10 min)\n* Close Meeting (JoeG) (5 min)"

Introduction to LLMs - Overview of Generative AI and potential Use Cases\n2. LLM Risk - Risks associated with LLM and how they differ from other types of AI\n3. AI Risk management and ML Ops - Core capabilities that support the management of AI and Generative AI risks\n\n#### Talk 2 \u2013 The iSOON Leak: What Is It and How to Analyse It\n\nSpeaker: Jim Slaughter\n\nIn late February, an unusual event occurred. While it was widely known the PRC was actively engaged in espionage around the world, glimpses into how this was done were few and far between. Then a repo appeared on GitHub.\nThe iSOON leak has revealed a significant amount of information about the internal operations and capabilities of a state-affiliated hacking contractor in China. Given the challenges of analysing a large trove of files (often without the aid of a native language speaker), new ways of utilizing technology (including AI) were needed to fully understand this dataset.\n\nBio:\nWho Am I?
