We need to rethink our approach.\nIn this talk, Haoxi will talk about trench stories over the last 6 months of running DirectCyber, a volunteer based CSIRT that tracks exposures to critical vulnerabilities and notifies potential victims with pinpoint accuracy. He will cover why this was feasible to run with 2.5-person team, how to prioritise which vulnerabilities to track, challenges for disclosure, and legal concerns. He will share success cases from other public and private sector companies such as DIVD and TruffleSec, along with the bigger picture of how we can influence government security strategy for the better if we work together."

        "description": "**Can we outsmart the adversaries? (Effective) Cyber Deception with Honeypots**\nIn today's ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, traditional defence mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with attacker ingenuity. Cyber deception offers a proactive approach, utilizing traps and deceiving tactics to lure attackers into controlled environments. Honeypots are one of the prominent techniques of cyber deception that act as decoy systems for capturing attacks and analyzing the adversary strategy. They provide an early detection mechanism as well as a method for learning how adversaries work and think. However, over the past years, several researchers have shown methods for fingerprinting honeypots. This significantly decreases the value of a honeypot; if an attacker can recognize the existence of such a system, they can evade it. This talk delves into the world of cyber deception, focusing on honeypots, their efficacy, and some fingerprinting techniques from my research. We'll explore how honeypots function and the contributions from The Honeynet Project, a non-profit, open-source community.\n**Speaker:** [Shreyas Srinivas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyas-srinivasa-ph-d-47038b13/overlay/contact-info/) is Cyber Security Specialist at TERMA Group, Co-founder of Selene CTI and previously Security Researcher at Aalborg University. He is contributor to the [Honeynet project](https://www.honeynet.org/), a non-profit dedicated to investigating the latest attacks and developing open source security tools to improve Internet security.\n\n**Information-Flow Security for the Working Software Engineer**\nHow does information flow through your software? Awareness of this gives you a new perspective when writing software with security requirements; it helps you avoid introducing information leaks into software, and gives you a conceptual framework for reasoning about software security in general.\nIn this talk, you will meet concepts like information leak, sources & sinks, dependencies, side\u2013channels, and flow policies. You will learn to identify information flows in software, to express application\u2013specific security requirements as flow policies, and to implement software that adheres to said flow policies.\nWant to try this out? Then bring a laptop; right after the talks, I will organize a little activity where you can tinker with \\`ifc-ts\\` - my TypeScript library for expressing flow policies. In \\`ifc-ts\\`, flow policy checks are reduced to checks performed by TypeScript's type checker. Thus, if your code type-checks, then your code is guaranteed to adhere to the flow policies expressed therein.\n\n**Speaker:** [Willard Rafnsson](https://www.willardthor.com/) is Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). I am a member of the Center for Information Security and Trust (CISAT), as well as the Programming, Logic and Semantics (PLS) and Software Quality Research (SQUARE) groups.\n\n**Location:** to be announced"

All problems will be based on real situations, with examples whenever possible. I will propose solutions for different teams' maturity levels, giving practical tips to start implementing security in the developers' pipeline.\n\nBio:\nTiago Mendo is a co-founder and CTO of Probely, a cybersecurity company that does web and API security scanning. With over 19 years of experience in the security field, he has extensive experience in pentesting applications, training, and providing all-around security consultancy.\nHolds a Master's in Information Security from Carnegie Mellon University and a CISSP certification. He is also a qualified member of AP2SI, a non-profit organization that promotes Information Security, and Co-Leader of the OWASP Lisboa Chapter, in Portugal.\nHe is also an international speaker at security conferences, such as SnowFROC, LASCON, BSides Krak\u00f3w, and BSides Lisbon.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagomendo/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagomendo/)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Harnessing Reachability Analysis to Discern Real Threats in Software Dependencies**\n\nSpeaker: **Joseph Hejderup**\n\nAbstract:\nIn this talk, we will dive into the shortcomings of traditional dependency analysis methods, which usually focus on looking at build manifests and metadata, to spot security or performance vulnerabilities in Java projects. While tools like Maven Dependency Checker and Gradle's dependency-analysis plugin are invaluable for their ability to manage dependencies, they often fall short when we need quick and precise answers, forcing developers to lean on time-consuming tests and manual code reviews. We believe that a thorough look at how dependencies are actually used in the code\u2014with the help of static and reachability analyses\u2014can be a more effective way to pinpoint real threats in Java dependencies.\n\nWe'll use real-world examples to show how static analysis, and in particular reachability analysis, offers deeper insights into potential vulnerabilities by moving beyond simple metadata. By sharing examples where static analysis has been a game-changer, and pointing out where it might not be enough, we aim to shed light on the challenges and opportunities this method brings to improving security and performance in software projects.\n\nOur goal is to provide attendees with practical strategies for using static and reachability analyses, promoting a more detailed method for managing dependencies and finding vulnerabilities in software applications.\n\nBio:\nPart-time developer, part-time PhD student, full-time enthusiast in developing and researching techniques that makes package management system more intelligent and resilient against supply chain problems! Joseph Hejderup (Researcher/Software Engineer at Endor Labs & PhD student at Delft University of Technology) is applying program analysis techniques to better understand how we use third-party components and what risks third-party components entails from a security and maintenance perspective. Currently, he is applying years of research in Endor Labs with the mission to make dependency management a robust process that will empower developers, increase productivity, and solve security problems.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephhejderup/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephhejderup/)"

        "description": "With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\nFor example, in the case of OpenAI's baseline codebase, there is a dependency on tensorflow that is not explicitly declared and is hence a phantom dependency This can cause unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. We show how using type-aware program analysis to create call graphs and perform reachability helps us determine the correct dependency set for a codebase irrespective of what is in the manifest.\n\nProgram analysis aims to extract information from software programs to enhance reliability, security, and performance. This session explores program analysis, specifically reachability analysis in Python, and delves into phantom dependencies - often overlooked in Python applications.\n\nPython's dynamic typing and interpreted nature make it a challenging subject for reachability analysis. The lack of type information makes it hard to precisely determine what dependency/features are used in the code.\n\nIn summary, program analysis, including Python's unique challenges, is essential in software development. Phantom dependencies in Python underscore the significance of meticulous dependency management for code reliability and security. Understanding these concepts is vital for Python developers aiming to build robust software. This abstract sheds light on program analysis complexities and the pitfalls of phantom dependencies, offering valuable insights into Python development and software reliability."

With a large set of proposed and active laws, software development will be regulated like never before.\n\nWith the coming EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) all software and embedded systems will have to get a CE mark, which is now expanded to include cybersecurity aspects. It\u2019s going to be a huge change and will mean that the manufacturers (and in some cases importers) will get responsibility for the user\u2019s security and will have to provide free security patches for the lifetime of the product. Software developers will have to learn secure coding and the need for cyber security professionals will be very high.\n\nOne of the focus areas is vulnerability management. To keep a product secure during its lifetime, all 3rd party components will have to be monitored and up to date. At the heart of this process is the Software Bill of Materials, SBOM, which is used to monitor for known vulnerabilities in both Open Source and commercial components. The OWASP CycloneDX project fits right in and have been working with various kinds of bill-of-materials for a long time. CycloneDX is in the process of becoming an ECMA standard and thus fits better in to the EU regulation.\n\nIn this talk Olle E. Johansson will introduce the proposed EU CRA legislation and talk about the SBOM with a focus on the toolchain needed to manage vulnerabilities.\n\nWe will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by a presentation that will start at 18:00. The talk will be around 1 hour long followed by a further mingle/time for questions and answers.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nJoin OWASP Stockholm mailing list to get notified of upcoming events [https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter)\nJoin our Slack channel on OWASP Slack *[#chapter-stockholm](https://owasp.slack.com/)*"

With 14 years of enterprise experience and a lifelong passion for hacking\u2014now spanning two decades\u2014Daniel brings a wealth of expertise to the cybersecurity field. He still offers some Security Architectural consultancy for different companies across Europe, and from time to time, he engages in bounty hunting. When not decoding the matrix of cyber threats, Daniel enjoys life with his wife and two boys, plays football twice a week, and maintains a spirited sense of humor\u2014because in cybersecurity, sometimes, you really can't afford to joke.\n***\\~Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall\\~***\nEffective cybersecurity is not just about having defenses in place but ensuring they are properly designed. 'Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall' illuminates the common pitfalls in firewall implementations that often go unnoticed. This presentation will demonstrate typical design errors that compromise security and provide actionable insights on how to rectify these flaws to create robust defenses. Attendees will learn how to not only deploy but also optimize firewalls to safeguard their digital assets effectively.\n\n**Alina NICULA** - **VASP Lead and Product security assessment service owner and reviewer @Visma**. Alina has been working within product development teams as a software developer, security engineer, software and cloud service architect. In the last years she focused on software security by guiding Visma teams into securing their applications, data, cloud workloads, and delivery pipelines to avoid potential cybersecurity risks.\n***\\~Running a Product Security Assessment Program at scale\\~***\nHaving a product security assessment program is essential for any company. It is equally critical to ensure that this program remains relevant over the time and is scalable as the company grows.In this presentation, I will discuss how we ensure that our designed processes empower development teams to make informed security decisions while also giving them ownership over the remediation of the security aspects that impact their products.\nHowever, achieving this goal requires a strong and knowledgeable security review team that supports the delivery teams with informed security by design best practices.\nSo, how have we been able to grow our program? I hope you will leave this presentation with a clear understanding of our approach.\n\n**Adrian BARAN -** **Security Manager @ VITESCO**,\n\n***\\~ Contingency plan from security point of view \\~***\nAbstract:"
