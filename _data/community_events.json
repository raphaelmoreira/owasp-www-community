        "description": "**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* **You need to accept your attendance 14 days before start, April 9th!**\n* **You need to reverse into the parking spot!**\n\nOWASP Aarhus and Siemens Gamesa are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup - in Brande.\n\n**19:00 \u2013 19:05** Welcome by Siemens Gamesa and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:05 \u2013 20:00** Matija Stevanovic\n**Title:** *Safeguarding Wind Power \u2013 Cybersecurity in the context of Wind Power Plants*\n**Abstract:**\nIn recent years, the global energy landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation, with renewable energy sources emerging as pivotal players in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Among these, wind power has surged to the forefront, harnessing the natural force of wind to generate clean and efficient electricity. As we embrace the transition towards greener energy solutions, it is imperative that we also confront the challenges that accompany it. One such challenge, though perhaps less visible, is cybersecurity.\nThroughout this presentation, we will delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity as it pertains to wind power plants. We will explore the broader business context, provide overview of customer expectations and the increasingly stringent requirements imposed by national legislators. Additionally, we will sketch the threats and vulnerabilities facing these critical assets. Finally, we will provide an overview of the strategies and technologies deployed to mitigate these risks, ensuring the resilience and safety of our wind power infrastructure amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.\n\n**20:00 \u2013 20:30** Networking break\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** Aleksander Kj\u00e6r vil give en grundl\u00e6ggende introduktion til forhandling baseret p\u00e5 Harvard Negotiations Project og Uri & Fishers bog \"Getting to Yes\".\n\nHan vil introducere n\u00f8glekoncepterne og teknikkerne inden for forhandling og vise, hvordan deltagerne selv kan anvende disse til at forbedre deres forhandlingsevner - b\u00e5de professionelt og personligt. Det er hans holdning, at alle kan blive en dygtig forhandler!\nDerudover vil han illustrere disse teknikker med konkrete eksempler fra virkelige forhandlingssituationer.\n\nHan vil ogs\u00e5 pr\u00e6sentere, hvordan man kan overbevise en tv\u00e6r og n\u00e6rrig ledelse om at investere mere i IT-sikkerhed ved hj\u00e6lp af de forhandlingsteknikker, der har gennemg\u00e5et.\n\nKort om Aleksander - Jeg har en kandidatgrad i \u00f8konomi og antropologi og har altid haft stor interesse for forhandling gennem mine studier, is\u00e6r i en international kontekst. Bl.a. var jeg i praktik p\u00e5 den danske ambassade i Tallinn Estland i 2018, hvor der skete en masse inden for det milit\u00e6re og cyber- og informationssikkerhed omr\u00e5det i Danmark og Estland. Efterf\u00f8lgende tilbragte jeg fire m\u00e5neder i New York City, hvor jeg skrev mit speciale om danske virksomheders udfordringer med at etablere sig p\u00e5 det amerikanske marked. P\u00e5 nuv\u00e6rende tidspunkt studerer jeg softwareteknologi p\u00e5 6. semester og er s\u00e6rligt interesseret i governance-omr\u00e5det inden cyber- og informationssikkerhed, som jeg h\u00e5ber at g\u00f8re en karriere indenfor i fremtiden.\n\n21:15 \u2013 21:30 Closing notes and goodbyes"

Join us as we discuss vulnerabilities identified in [points.com](http://points.com/) and other pieces of airline infrastructure which lead to mass PII disclosure, an infinite money glitch, and free upgrades.\n\n**Talk #2 -** Secrets from a bygone era by **Dylan Ayrey**\nGitHub is a platform that was designed for sharing, it wasn't designed for unsharing. So how difficult does it become to unshare? This talk will dig into all the different ways your secrets might get replicated, propagated, persisted, and shared, for decades following your mistake.\n\n**Talk#3** The Internet is broken, Putting IPv6 into perspective\n**Description**:\nMost of the Internet is currently running on a legacy version of the Internet Protocol: IPv4. Despite of this, the number of engineers, especially in security, who know how to use IPv6 is relatively low. In this talk, previously presented internally at NCC Group, I will show you why today's Internet does not live up to its original vision, take you back to the past to show you what the IPv4 Internet used to look like and through this reveal the secrets that will make you understand IPv6.\n\n**Speaker**:**Denis Smajlovi\u0107,** Founding Security Consultant at Nova Information Security. With a background in security consulting having worked for some of the largest financial institutions in Scandinavia and biggest tech companies in the Bay Area, I started Nova to provide web application and network pentesting services with the idea that we are able to work closer with clients and provide greater value."

One more may come, so hold on to your hats!\nSo far we have:\n\n* An Intro to OSINTer\n* Tracking down the killer (with OSINT)\n\nHere's a brief synopis:\n\n**OSINTer**\n*Synopsis*\nOSINTer is a new, digital platform tailored towards breezing through the complexities involved in extracting strategic cyber threat intelligence from news about cyber threats. Designed to streamline the traditionally laborious process of manually tracing and compiling data, OSINTer offers an automated, efficient means of identification, collection, and tracking of the ever moving cyberthreat landscape. At this workshop we will delve into the platform's journey from a spark of an idea to a robust platform, currently serving 30.000 monthly users, and go over how you can integrate it into your daily work, helping you stay on top of the constant inflow of information.\n\n*Speaker bio*\nBertram Madsen and David Clayton co-conspirators in the realm of cybersecurity, with each specializing in different facets of the industry to combat digital threats effectively. Bertram, a proficient full-stack software developer, emphasizes open-source development and community collaboration, manifesting in the creation of a range of cybersecurity solutions. Most notably, he's responsible for the development of OSINTer, a digital platform designed to ease collection of strategic cyber threat intelligence (CTI), and in collaboration with David, they are attempting to rethink how we do CTI. David is an established leader within Denmark's cybersecurity landscape, with a breadth of experience spanning various critical infrastructure sectors, financial security and strategic leadership roles. He's renowned for championing the SagaLabs concept, gaining TF-CSIRT certification for his team, and providing exceptional insights as one of only two official SIM3 auditors in Denmark.\n\n**Tracking down the killer**\n*Synopsis*\nIn the mid 1990\u2019s Rasmus Kierkegaard Kristiansen \u2013 suspected of killing and dismembering a business partner I Portugal \u2013 managed to escape and hide from authorities. After a longer period of intense investigation, the trail was considered cold.\nIn 2018, 25 years after the murder, the unsolved case was still bugging the leading investigator at the time. He teams up with a TV production company to give the investigation another shot. As a\nbase requirement for funding, Kristoffer Scavenius was tasked with making a probable case that the murderer was in fact still alive. After initial setbacks, Kristoffer was eventually able to make the\ncase that Rasmus Kierkegaard Kristiansen was still alive and well, living in Sao Paolo, Brazil.\nThe talk will discuss some of the OSINT approaches used in this investigation.\n\n*Speaker bio*\nKristoffer Scavenius has worked in OSINT since 2013 and has held positions as researcher/programmer in both government and the private sector."

Networking with your peers starts at 5:00 - food is served at 5:30 and the presentation starts at 6:00.\n\n**Presentation:** AppSec 2.0: Reimagine AppSec With Runtime Analysis\n\n**Abstract:** SCA tools (container and dependency scans) generate too much noise. Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, Kiran Kamity, CEO and Founder of Deepfactor, will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime reachability analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications"

Talk:** **Data Centricity for Cloud and Application Security**\n\n*Prof. Dr. Igor Podebrad, Director CISO Office, Google Cloud*\n\nIgor's talk will demystify data-centricity as a key driver for robust application and cloud security. He'll contrast the shift to data-centricity focus how it underpins cloud, AI and supports sound risk decisions. He will also discuss how this shift is reshaping security and resilience in for digital transformation. Igor is currently a Director at Google Cloud's Office of the CISO and a former Group CISO at Commerzbank AG. He holds a PhD in Medical Care Logistics from the University of Berlin.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Securing GenAI Applications on Cloud: Three pronged approach**\n\n*Hari Hayagreevan - Senior Cloud Security Architect, IBM*\n\nThe convergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) with cybersecurity introduces a spectrum of challenges and prospects. To embrace Gen AI extensively within enterprise contexts, it's imperative for these AI systems to be devoid of vulnerabilities in their application and infrastructure. This necessitates a holistic approach to securing Gen AI platforms. In this session, Hari will take you through the different viewpoints, offering insights from an Enterprise Security Architect\u2019s perspective, with practical enterprise scenarios. Hari is Enterprise Security Architect and currently is the Technical Leader for IBM Consulting\u2019s GenAI Security practice in DACH. He started his career as Cybersecurity incident responder (SOC Analyst) 18 years ago and now advises Enterprise CISOs and Security Architecture teams on adopting security principles for preventing cyber attacks.\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks**.

Meeting this challenge is not just about building secure applications since we all know that rapid development of software as well as the evolution of threats and vulnerabilities can see our applications as secure today but vulnerable tomorrow. That is why having an established product security team and response capability is extremely important.\nDuring this discussion, I will discuss, using real-world examples, including that of my own, how organizations can meet the demands of product security including:\n\n* Building a culture of security within your organization beyond firewalls and anti-virus\n* How to \u201csell\u201d security to executive management and explaining what product security does and doesn\u2019t do (e.g., staffing, budgets, etc.)\n* Building and deploying software using the \"DevOps\" approach, while maintaining a high level of security\n* The difficulties of wearing multiple hats, with security being one of them Embedding \u201csecurity\u201d in the software development life cycle (SDLC)\n* Establishing a proper security \u201cresponse\u201d program Product vulnerability transparency and developing a disclosure policy How to measure the success of your program\n* Establishing a bug bounty program\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[DevOcean](https://www.devocean.security)*\n*DevOcean Cloud-First Remediation OS helps organizations cut the time, backlog and manual efforts required to close more issues, reduce MTTR and the attack surface. It is an API-based SaaS that connects the dots between cloud, code, security scanner and alert tools to consolidate and enrich remediation context with root cause analysis, owner identification, customized prioritization and tailored fix suggestions.*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

AI Risk management and ML Ops - Core capabilities that support the management of AI and Generative AI risks\n\n#### Talk 2 \u2013 The iSOON Leak: What Is It and How to Analyse It\n\nSpeaker: Jim Slaughter\n\nIn late February, an unusual event occurred. While it was widely known the PRC was actively engaged in espionage around the world, glimpses into how this was done were few and far between. Then a repo appeared on GitHub.\nThe iSOON leak has revealed a significant amount of information about the internal operations and capabilities of a state-affiliated hacking contractor in China. Given the challenges of analysing a large trove of files (often without the aid of a native language speaker), new ways of utilizing technology (including AI) were needed to fully understand this dataset.\n\nBio:\nWho Am I? I'm Canadian, eh! Currently a Senior Threat Intel Engineer at Fortinet\n\n* Day-to-day responsible for looking for \"interesting samples\", and reversing them. Blogs - [https://www.fortinet.com/blog/search?author=James+Slaughter](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/search?author=James+Slaughter)\n\nPrior to Fortinet:\n\n* 8 years at NatWest as the Cyber Threat Hunting and Analytics Tech Lead\n* 10 years at BlackBerry as a Dev\n\nMy hobbies match my vocation.

Unsurprising to security practitioners, perhaps, is the security implications that follow an explosive cycle of implementation. Companies are implementing fast and new security concerns are arising daily, before their traditional security teams can even answer the question \u201cWhat is AI/ML?\u201d\n\nPresenter:\n\nDavid Benas\n\nDavid Benas, AI Security practice lead within Synopsys, will leverage Synopsys Consulting\u2019s broad experience with many large clients and industry partners to present an introduction on AIML security; including an overview of the current implementation & threat landscape, the risks and challenges you should be aware of, and share some (hopefully very fun, or perhaps scary, depending on where you are in the process) anecdotes along the way."

In this presentation, we will delve into objective methods for assessing the quality of static analysis detections without incurring additional resources. We\u2019ll learn about how Microsoft\u2019s M365 Application Security team develops new detections and how they evaluate the effectiveness of those detections to ensure maximum impact at reducing security risk.\n\n**David Streat** is an experienced application security professional with almost 20 years in software development and application security. Having led Appsec teams at both EA and Microsoft, David has always strived to create solutions that improve code security where developers work.
