Lindsay will be giving her presentation an Overview of the PROXYLIB Campaign.\n\nIn May 2023, we identified a cluster of VPN apps available on the Google Play Store that transformed the user\u2019s device into a proxy node without their knowledge. We\u2019ve dubbed this operation PROXYLIB. Other researchers identified this malicious behavior in a single free VPN application\u2014Oko VPN\u2014 which resulted in the app's removal from the Play Store. Based on further analysis of Oko VPN, Satori researchers uncovered 27 additional applications related to PROXYLIB. These apps shared a common native library, written in Golang, that enrolls the device as a proxy node. This talk will provide a high-level overview of the PROXYLIB Android malware and take the listener through the changes we observed in response to defenders\u2019 actions.\n\nLindsay Kaye is the Vice President of Threat Intelligence at HUMAN Security. Her technical specialty spans the fields of malware analysis and reverse engineering, with a keen interest in dissecting custom cryptographic systems. Lindsay is an internationally-recognized cybersecurity speaker and author. Lindsay holds a BS in Engineering with a Concentration in Computing from Olin College of Engineering and an MBA from Babson College."

Whether through infiltrating the software delivery pipeline, deliberately uploading malicious components to popular repositories, or taking advantage of existing vulnerabilities in open source components, attackers are leveraging gaps in supply chain controls to compromise organizations. With GenAI quickly becoming a popular tool for developers to generate code, a new threat has emerged. AI package hallucinations is one of the more recent attack types within supply chain that is easy to execute and can have devastating effects. During this session we will give an overview of Supply Chain Security with some examples of the current threats, discuss AI package hallucinations, and preventative measures."

We\u2019re eager to share with the community a practical and innovative approach that worked for us: How we were able to move away from manually reviewing every feature developed while increasing the thoroughness of our security oversight. We\u2019ll explain how we succeeded at integrating generative AI tools using GitHub actions to automate the code review process and broaden security oversight in a highly efficient way. Attendees will learn from our journey and discover how they, too, can automate routine security checks, engaging human experts only when their expertise is truly needed.\n 19:20 to 19:30 - Beer Break\n 19:30 to 20:15 - Pains and advantages of application anomaly detection in containerized applications\n*Ben Hirschberg - CTO @ ARMO*\nIn this talk an open-source based application anomaly detection system to detect malicious activity. The solution focuses on applications running in Kubernetes orchestration system.\nIn the talk I will cover these points:\n\\* Main attack vectors to these kinds of applications: exploit remote vulnerabilities, supply-chain attacks\n\\* Anomaly detection dimensions: process, file, network and system-call activity\n\\* What detection dimension is working (or not working) with what kind of applications\n\\* What anomalies are bound to what kind of attacks\n\\* Live demo with the Kubescape project to show results\n\n 20:15 to 21:00 - The Dark Side of AI: The Hidden Risks in Open-Source AI Models\n*Jossef Harush Kadouri - Security Researcher @ Checkmarx*\nThis talk is for anyone who is using open source in their daily routine. The purpose is to bring awareness to the risks of software supply chain attackers lurking in some of our open-source code and to show how ridiculously easy it is for them to launch attacks.\nJoin me as we unravel the construction of AI models, focusing on their weak spots. Through multiple demos, witness how AI models can be manipulated to become malicious.\n\n====================================================================\nThis event is hosted by Axonius in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

Learn why every SCA tool is wrong, and how to deal with it.**\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Darren Meyer**, Lead Solution Architect at Endor Labs.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)*\n*Endor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise. Endor Labs\u2019 mission is to help developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe code reuse. With this solution, development and security teams are able to maximize software reuse by safely evaluating, maintaining, and updating dependencies at scale.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Despite what I thought I knew, the reality was far more intricate.\n\nModern software development is a sprawling network of open-source dependencies, sophisticated build tools, plugins, pipelines, and runtimes. These components are fundamental in securing critical sectors of our daily lives\u2014finance, healthcare, infrastructure, transportation, and social interactions. However, this supply chain is under relentless attack and many of the potential threats are poorly understood.\n\nThis talk will delve into specific vulnerabilities, such as dependency poisoning and pipeline compromises, that exemplify the challenges we face. We\u2019ll explore strategies to mitigate these threats and discuss practical takeaways that attendees can immediately implement in their software development practices. Expect to leave with a deeper understanding of supply chain security and with ideas to fortify your software factory against these escalating threats.\n\n*Bio:*\nDavid Archer is a Solution Architect at Endor Labs. He began his career as a software developer and witnessed significant shifts in how software is built over the last two decades. After spells as a development lead, product director and pre-sales consultancy roles David consistently saw a concerning trend: security often took a backseat amidst the hustle and bustle of development priorities.\n\nSeeking to help address this balance David took an opportunity in 2018 to work full-time in the field of application security with a particular focus on technologies that promise to enhance security without impeding development speed. Through his extensive experience with secure coding practises and hands-on experience with the myriad of code analysis tools like IAST, SAST, DAST, RASP and SCA, he gained valuable insights into their relevance and effectiveness in a modern software factory.\n\n**Technical leverage: dependencies are a mixed blessing**\n*Abstract:*\nModern applications are build upon a large supply chain of (possibly open source) libraries and tools. In finance, leverage is the ratio of debts (other people\u2019s money) vs equity (your money) and the Lehman Brothers have made that concept famous. For software, technical leverage is the ratio between other people\u2019s code and your own code. I will argue with some examples from the Maven, Python and the NPM ecosystems that this is both a risk and an opportunity. The Lehmans Brothers were 30 to 1, what about the Software Sisters?\n\n*Bio:*\nFabio Massacci is a co-author of CVSS v4. Among other things, he is also a professor at Vrije Universiteit. He has been a speaker at hackers\u2019 venues (BlackHat USA, Asia) scientific security conferences (IEEE S&P, CCS), software engineering (ICSE,MSR) and risk analysis (SRA). He coordinates the EU project Sec4AI4Sec (name tells it all) and an NWO project on using AI for security threat intelligence. While almost all professors are sellers of tech (through their papers or their spin-offs) he was also for 7 years deputy for ICT procurements and services supervising a 70+ workforce and few millions Euro in outsourcing contracts. Being a buyer of tech makes a difference in perspective."

Akt \\- Heinrichstrasse 262\\, 8005 Zurich \\.** Enjoy the community.\n\n**Talk details:**\n\n* **OWASP Mobile Application Security for Developers and Penetration Testers**: Mobile applications are central to digital life today. To ensure that mobile e-banking, door controls, health data, personal messages and photos are secure, mobile applications should also be developed securely. As the threat model for a mobile app can differ from other kinds of applications, frameworks such as the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) may not cover all the relevant IT security topics.\n* **Beyond the Top 10: Limits of a Finite Checklist**: In his talk, Marco will share insights from almost two decades of experience with the OWASP Top 10. He will discuss how this checklist has advanced web application security and brought critical issues to the forefront and also to the attention of non-technical people.\nMarco will provide real-world project anecdotes to highlight the limits of the Top 10, particularly in stakeholder communication. He will explore how broader resources like OWASP ASVS and SAMM provide additional guidance and fit into the bigger picture of establishing security practices.\nThe talk will conclude with an outlook on integrating practical checklists with detailed frameworks to enhance security strategies and stakeholder understanding. This session is a must for those seeking to bridge the gap between vulnerabilities and effective communication..\n* **Cloud Security**: This presentation will review opportunities to address OWASP challenges using security elements of a cloud platform. Example elements will be discussed to show how platform features can help to mitigate web application threats. The emerging OWASP Cloud-Native Application Security Top 10 will also be reviewed and discussed, with insights also being given into how cloud platform provider and customer can work together in a Security by Design, Security by Default and Security in Deployment approach.\n* **Confidential Computing**: Encryption of data at rest and in transit are two well-established and generally advisable best practices for protecting IT environments. They can be implemented leveraging a plethora of tested and proven technologies such as disk encryption and network security. But what happens when data is processed, therefore not being at rest or in transit? At this point data becomes available in memory, usually in unencrypted to allow processing. This provides a window of opportunity for attackers to gain unallowed access to the data or perform various actions on it. Mitigating some of these attack vectors is what confidential computing aims to do. In this talk I will provide a brief overview over the concepts and outline use cases and limitations. There might after all be some caveats to it..."

Currently building an online community and creating a podcast series, Chris draws on expertise from more than 15 years of direct security experience and over 35 years of experience leading teams in programming and software, solutions, and security architecture.\n\nFor three years, Chris built and led an entire application security program that includes the implementation of mature AppSec programs, including oversight of security processes and procedures, SAST, DAST, CSA/OSA, compliance, training, developer communication, code reviews, application inventory gathering, and risk analysis.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nIn 2023, 71% of enterprises admitted their AppSec programs were reactive, playing catch-up with vulnerability alerts -- while at the same time, applications remain the top target for threat actors. That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?\nThe key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk.\n\nJoin Chris Lindsey, Application Security Evangelist, for an in-depth discussion of what it takes to stop playing defense when it comes to application security. He'll wrangle over topics like:\n\n* The tell-tale signs of reactive mode\n* The value of preventative best practices\n* How to build security actions into the developer experience\n* The need for a holistic view and effective prioritization\n* Arming the security team with instant control at scale\n\n**Location:**\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Drive W\nSte 600\nTampa, FL\n\n**Sponsors:**\n[Mend](https://www.mend.io/)"
