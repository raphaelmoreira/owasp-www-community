Most mature languages have a (sometimes) mature package management system, either built-in (e.g., Rust's cargo) or de facto (e.g., Maven) that allows developers to define dependencies, resolve conflicts and do composition analysis.\n\nSBOMs, however, allow you to take this one step further, making it language-agnostic and allowing components from different ecosystems to use a common language for comparisons and analysis. However, we don't get those features out of the box. For example, consider common libraries in different package repositories - are all OpenSSL packages created equally and equivalent?\n\nOWASP is playing a part in this via its support for projects like CycloneDX which aims to provide a full-stack BOM standard to cover specific scopes such as the CBOM (Cryptography) and HBOM (Hardware) among others.\n\nThis shift towards software being more transparent and traceable is not without its detractors, as entire business models are predicated on customers using purely opaque boxes.\n\nIn the spirit of the topic, here is a Talk Bill of Topics:\n\n\\- Are BOM requirements burdensome?\n\\- Are we revealing too much of the \"secret sauce\"?\n\\- Does having an SBOM instantly make a piece of software more secure?\n\\- If we take a piece of software and replace every entry in its BOM with fully equivalent packages\\, one by one\\, is it still the same software in the end?\n\nThis talk targets a beginner to intermediate audience and will provide an overview of (S)BOMs, their ongoing challenges, and what they can bring to the table in terms of security.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with an interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

        "description": "**Hands on Workshop** \"Vulnerability Reachability Analysis Using OSS Tools\"\n\nHello AppSec teams and tech enthusiasts! We're thrilled to roll out an exceptional DevSecOps workshop in collaboration with **OWASP LA** and offered by [Deepfactor](https://www.deepfactor.io/). This workshop will walk you through the process of using runtime analysis using OSS (Open Source Software) tools to identify which vulnerable components in an application are actually loaded into memory and, therefore, represent a higher risk to your business. You\u2019ll learn how to be a hero in your organization by helping your dev teams save time and fix a significantly smaller number of high-risk vulnerabilities!.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nNew vulnerabilities are disclosed every day in dependencies that you or your team may be using. But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This workshop will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability (1) static call graphs and (2) runtime analysis, and help in deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n## **Workshop Overview**\n\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n## **Outcome/Learnings**\n\n* Understand what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important\n* Compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis)\n* Via hands-on experience, use both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered.\n* Learn how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

And forcing security onto developers often has an adverse effect. In this talk we will share the journey we have been making at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) to get Development teams to adopt DevSecOps in a way that works best for them. Topics that will be discussed include Secure Development training, Security Champions, Threat Modeling and using the right tooling.\n\n*Bio:*\nSebastiaan Rijnbout has a background as .NET developer and has worked in that field for over 12 years, but since 2017 he has started focusing on AppSec and Dev(Sec)Ops.\n\nWhen getting teams and organisations to adopt DevSecOps, Sebastiaan will look at all aspects of DevSecOps (People, Process and Technology) like setting up developer training programs and security champion programs, rolling out company-wide Security tooling and improving working processes. But always keeping a focus on making things easy and efficient for developers.\n\nIn his current role at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) Sebastiaan acts as Product Owner for 4 Dev(Sec)Ops support teams. These teams are responsible for enabling all development teams at KVK to deliver secure and high-quality software as efficiently as possible.\n\n**Cracking the API: Challenges in IoT and Modern Applications**\n*Abstract:*\nSecuring API\u2019s is about more than just an endpoint, it\u2019s about the data shared, customer privacy, and the access we give to unauthorised parties. Now as we are connecting more devices than ever, to more third parties than ever, securing APIs needs an offensive mindset from the design phase.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll go over some of the techniques I use when testing, common issues I\u2019ve found and their impact, and the state of IoT and modern web applications.\n\nSecurity issues can arise from misconceptions early in the software process, so I\u2019ll also discuss how we might mitigate some of these with thoughtful design, architecture and development.\n\n*Bio:*\nFrom user experience to software engineering, Yianna has a diverse background with one thing in common - exploring the intersection between human interaction and technology. Currently she is an Offensive and Application Security Engineer at Xebia. Working in tech teams and researching new offensive techniques remains a daily drive for her. She\u2019s passionate about giving back to the community, having presented at DEFCON, hosted security meetups, delivered workshops, contributed to OWASP Low Code / No Code, as well as building and contributing to open source tooling."
